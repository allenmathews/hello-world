# hello-world <br>
Just another repository <br>

I am writing this read-me to help me understand how the various git commands work on Github. If you would like to do the same exercise please visit https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ <br>

This is my second edit and I had earlier learnt how to do a pull request along with a merge operation. Furthermore, I had also deleted the branch that I used to write the first edit and which I eventually merged to the main branch.
